A level Computer Science Coding Project
Current System
Currently my local primary school gives each student a printed copy of their report in an envelope which they are told to bring home to their parents. The parents then must rely on that one copy for future reference.
Problem
The issue with this is physical reports can often get lost or damaged especially when given to young students. It also costs the school money to print.
aims
For my project I aim to make a platform where teachers can write reports and students/parents would be able to log into the website to view their report from their teacher. This would eliminate the need for students to have to bring physical copies home where they may get lost or damaged along the way, it would also eliminate printing costs, and mean you can view and print the report anywhere anytime.
The Teacher would use their login to log into the website, they would then be brought to a menu where they are presented with options:
-	Create report
-	Settings
-	Log out
They would select “Create report” and then be brought to the creating a report menu with roughly the following options:
-	Student name/code
-	Date
-	Subject/Subjects (data base of subjects needed?)
-	Grade
-	Teachers notes
-	Submit
They should go to each option then enter required data, then submit, submit should have verify, if they submit without filling everything in correctly should require double verify. Each option should be robust and specify the format data should be entered in.
After submitting the report, the teacher is brought back to the main menu where they can either write their next report or logout.
The student/parent can use their login to log onto the website, they will then be brought to a similar main menu although “create report” would be replaced with “view report”
This then brings them to the next menu which will look like this:
-	Report n: teacher_account_name, subjects
-	…
-	Done
They should then select a report to view and they would see a menu exactly the same as the teachers creating report menu, although when they select an option they wouldn't be asked to enter data they would view the data entered by the teacher.
The settings options would include things like: change password, change username, other preferences.
You will need an admin account to add/remove teachers, subjects, change passwords/usernames, add/remove students

Maybe add flagging/report option so u can alert mistakes or some feedback feature
Teachers view and edit submitted reports?

Limitations of my system
My system would unfortunately rely on students or parents/carers to have an internet connection and a sufficient device to connect and view the report. It also opens up new issues regarding cybersecurity and data protection.
